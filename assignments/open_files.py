#NEWEST CODE: 
# max_price = -1
# max_product = "" # It doesn't matter what you set this to, it just needs to be declared

# for item in shopping_cart:
#     product_name = item[0] # Product name is the first part
#     price = item[1] 

#     if price > max_price:
#         # This is the new max
#         max_price = price

#         # Also save this product name as the max product
#         max_product = product_name

# print(f"The maximum price is: {max_price}")
# print(f"The product with the maximum price is: {max_product}")
